## JS Data Structures

### 1. Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

### 2. Dictionary

A dictionary is a general-purpose data structure for storing a group of objects. A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value. When presented with a key, the dictionary will return the associated value.

### 3. Graph

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.


### 4. Hash Table

A Hash Table (Hash Map) is a data structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. The efficiency of mapping depends of the efficiency of the hash function used.

### 5. Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers (references to previous elements in the list).

### 6. List

A list or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a countable number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.

### 7. Queue

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.


### 8. Stack

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
